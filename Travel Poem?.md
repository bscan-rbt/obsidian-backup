The last soft touch of the light of day
As the suns golden mask slips away
Warm pillows of amber hues
Slowly drowning in the inky blues
Revealing a cold and waxing moon
Dancing on the hilltops to some unknown tune
The treetops sway sleepily in the breathe of night
A choir of leaves sing gently in the lunar light
Melancholy tones of an ancient song
A story sung, both sad and long
Of a forest deity, both fierce and strong

But now from the thickets came a crescendo of brass
An orchestral arrangement of crickets and grass
Of night birds calling and lupine howling
Of rodent chatter and ursine growling
A raucous composition of fiends and ferals
In a nightly dance with prancing and perils
Slowly descending into a nocturnal ballet
A wondrous sight, an entrancing display

Slowly, slowly, the night fades away
As the sun brings forth the light of day
The music of the forest gently wanes
As the morning rays cross grassy planes
The forest canopy drawn back in a verdant curtain
The rhythmic sway of the trees, now uncertain
Soon replaced with a dissonant thrum
An song wrought of human bedlam
But beneath the noise and mechanized croon
The wind still whispers its airy tune
A solemn call to a hidden moon
Whispering gently, see you soon
