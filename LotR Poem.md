Under darkened skies and shadowed lands
Where our Doom is stayed by mortal hands
Hearts burdened by war and pain
Men were weak, and the were dwarves vain
Hope seemed lost and glory dimmed

But alas! The great kings proclaimed
While desperate, they rightly named
O Gil-adad! Strong as the gods will!
Bright as the stars and brighter still!
Come hither! Let the alliance be once more!
Let us push back these shadows as once before!
But the elves felt no doom in their immortal hearts
Mortals were petty, and they played their parts
Doomed to die er' the second music starts
Plagued by fury, lust and greed
Let them be thankful for their spirits freed!

O Gil-adad! Father! Immortal king!
Came her voice as clear as spring
The elven maiden pure and fair
She cried out to her father in despair
O Gil-adad! Father! Immortal king!
Let not the mortals fade in part!
Or so shall with them my noble heart!
For it is no longer under the Ainur's light
Alas! It belongs to a mortal man by right
If you part, I shall stay and with them perish
For with him, these last moments I can cherish

O my love! My child! My light!
His doom is certain, war or flight
His heart beats numbered still in peace
His mortal shell , a spirits lease!
O my love! My child! My light!
See clearly now a fathers plight!
This land is doomed, by the Ainur's will!
But hope for us there may be still
Beyond the sea our souls can stay
Until we can hear the second music play!

Folly be it, for hope is dim
But if you must, go to him
For while my mind is true and my eyes are keen
My heart grows dark for these tears I've seen
Words soft spoken by the king of kings
And thus the elven maiden sings
O Gil- alad! Father! Immortal king!
Then on these moors we shall not tarry!
Again we aid the weak and weary

The enemy was wise, his will strong
Power undimmed by even elven song
But strength in men he did not measure
He slaughtered their kin with twisted pleasure
But he could not know the line unbroken
Kings of men that tales had spoken
O Elendil! Blade of the North!
Let your mighty heirs come forth

Men and dwarves and elves together
Children of the music amongst each other
By blade and spear and axe alike
Shattered shields and Orcish pike
Advancing towards the shadows cast
The lord of dark felt fear at last!
By the might of kings and courage of man!
By elven grace, and dwarven strength they ran!
The final hour now approaching
The great enemy now encroaching

The might of the Dark Lord was great
The hour of twilight getting late
Upon them he inflicted his mighty doom
Tall above them did he loom
O by the grace of the Evenstar!
Untarnished it has travelled far!
O by the fearless heart of the North!
The great Dunadain set forth!
O by the strength of the mountains!
Away at last from the dwarven fountains!
By courage, did the Dark Lord falter
By light, did the fate of mortals alter
And at last he was stricken down
And at last was his weakness found

O glory! The orcs have scattered
The shadow of the east was tattered
Bless the mortals who died in glory
Mourn the elves who perished sorely
O Elendil! Your line is stronger!
Kingless are mortal men no longer!

Elven maiden so bright and fair
Grace by gods, and silken hair
At last she sought her mortal fare
With kings blood did hers bind
And love together did they find

The strength of men again redoubled
By shadows cast no longer troubled
Across the sea went the elves in grace
As told to preserve their noble race
The dwarves again dwell in the deep
But ties to man they did now keep
Lest fate bring them doom again
And evil bolstered now and then
For never was the story at an end
Tales untold, and many troubles to mend
But fate was fickle and sometimes kind
And long was peace and now we find
Men abound and dwarves below
What happens next we cannot know
