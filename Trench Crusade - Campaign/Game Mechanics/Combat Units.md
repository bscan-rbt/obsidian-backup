While skirmishes on the tabletop remain the same as traditional Trench Crusade rules, combat on the battle board will be much more birdseye view. There are two main types of combat units:

- **Standard Units:**  The name of these units will be determined by your faction, but these are your every day grunts that make up the bulk of any army. The majority of your units on the board will be Standard Units, optionally led by a Lieutenant who can provide additional exploration and combat bonuses.
- **Elite Units:** Elite units are smaller more specialized units that are used to engage the most important military targets. Most notably this will included your Warbands, representing a 1 for 1 accounting of that Warbands list. While these units can be very powerful, they are also your most prized forces, and you do not want to risk having them killed in battle or trapped. If a combat involves two opposing Warbands, it should usually (if not always) be resolved as a tabletop skirmish.

##### Supporting Units
Supporting units offer combat advantages, but are not included in the Military Power of the unit. This includes:
- Artillery
- Spies
- Saboteurs
- Medics
- Emissaries
