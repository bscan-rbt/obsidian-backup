Player turns will happen in two phases:
- **Planning Phase:** This phase happens simultaneously for all players. Here players will plan out their moves, take economic actions and confer with their allies. At the end of the planning phase players will commit their strategies.
- **Battle Phase:** Once players have committed their strategies, they will resolve any battles that occur (if any) and update the map accordingly. 

**Turn Order:**
Players can roll 1D6 for turn order on the battle phase. Going first here is not always preferable, is it gives the enemy information with which they can retaliate. 

**Time:**
- Each player round will represent 1 week of in game time.
- Combat rounds each represent 1 day of battle. If a battle reaches 7 days, that battle is suspended until the next Battle Phase. This gives enemies the opportunity to reinforce or take advantage of tied up forces, so over committing to a single battle may be a risky move.

**Movement:**
- Each combat unit will have a set movement speed that represents how many miles they can move in 1 day. 
- To plan their movement, simply multiply the number of days by their movement to attain their total distance moved.
- For reinforcement, this will determine how many days or weeks are required to reinforce.

**Economic Actions:**
- During the Planning Phase, players can take a number of Economic Actions:
	- *Recruit:* Recruit new units to increase your military power. Depending on your infrastructure, you can gain a maximum about of units per week while paying the cost of those units. This will also increase your *Upkeep* costs.
	- *Build:* Build new infrastructure to increase your means of production. Infrastructure will have a set cost and time to complete, though this may be modified by your factions abilities.
	- *Trade:* You can trade resources with nearby friendly factions, take or offer loans, and even sell your military might as a service.

**Military Actions:**
- During the planning phase, players can also prep their armies for battle:
	- *Promote:* Promote a elite unit or a lieutenant. See Trench Crusade campaign rules for Elite unit promotion. These promotions will also add to your Upkeep costs.
	- *Fortify:* Fortify your position, see fortification table for costs and requirements.
	- *Treat:* Units with Emissaries can attempt to treat with enemies, sending demands or offerings to attempt to avoid combat. 

**Exploration:**
- During the planning phase, you will map your troop movements and often will venture into the fog of war. Whenever you enter a territory you have not been, you will use the exploration rules from the Trench Crusade campaign rules.
- If two opposing forces meet in contested territory, they may initiate a Skirmish.

**Espionage:**
Gaining intel and sabotaging enemy forces can be a key strategy in achieving victory. Some factions may come better equipped than others for this endeavour, but all factions can send out Spies and Saboteurs. The number and effectiveness is determined by your faction and infrastructure. 
- **Intelligence:** Intelligence both gives the player information about the map state and a practical advantage in battle. Intelligence Dice can be added to combat and artillery rolls if you have battle initiative.
- **Sabotage:** Sabotage can mitigate a defender's defensive advantage, and will modify the roll required to achieve a successful attack.


##### Example Round:

**Planning Phase:**

- Player calculate income against their upkeep and adds or subtracts to their resources accordingly.
- Player builds 2 factories, subtracting the requisite resources.
- Player recruits 300 new units, adding their cost to the upkeep.
- Player plans a troop movement against a known enemy position
- Player send out 4 spies to attempt to gain intel, rolls a partial success and gains 2 intel dice

**Battle Phase:**

- Player engages enemy position with battle initiative. Enemy position has a fortified trench, reducing Artillery rolls by -4 and attack rolls by -3.
- Player rolls to attack with 5 D6 (3 from units, 2 from intel dice). He rolls an attack roll of 21, which in turn becomes 18 due to the fortification. The enemy rolls to defend, and only achieves a 12, reducing the Military Power of the defending force by 6.
- This continues for 3 more rounds, and the attacking player breaks the defenders position. The defender rolls to retreat, achieving a partial success, losing only 5 Military Power while retreating.
- The attacking player now controls the fortified position and the battleline moves up accordingly.
