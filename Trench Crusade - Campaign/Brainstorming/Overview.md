The main concept behind the design of the campaign will idea of a grand strategy game such as Hearts of Iron 4. The idea would be that using their limited resources, each faction would need to plot out their battle plans while ensuring sufficient supplies at home and in the field.  These rules are an extension of the existing Trench Crusade Campaign rules, you will still follow their PDF guide to manage your warband.

##### Digital vs Tabletop
Part of the goal of this campaign design would be to extend gameplay beyond tabletop skirmishes in a meaningful way. This means campaigns with remote players and others who cannot join on a regular basis would have the means to continue playing in between table top sessions. That being said, this is still Trench Crusade -- so any battle of importance should happen on the table top.

Possible ways of dealing with this are:
- **Queuing Battles:** Create a list of battles that need to be resolved in person as they come up, record the in game date of those battles and add them to a queue. These forces are considered 'tied up' until that battle is resolved, and the state of that battle line is frozen. 
- **Player Challenges:** Sometimes a player may not want to leave the fate of a battle to the digital dice board, they can challenge the battle and ask that it be added to the queue. There should be a limit on challenges though, to prevent gridlock on battlemap.
- **Rule of Cool:** Let's be honest, we're here to play with the cool ass grimdark minis that we spent so much time prepping. Sometimes this is all the impetus you need to schedule a tabletop session over a digital one.

##### Economy
Each faction will have an economy dictated by their geographic location and technological capabilities. The economy in game is a simplified version of available resources, to production capability, to military power gained:

- **Resources:** This value is a amalgamation of all available resources available to that country, and can be used to produce factories, recruit and train units and maintain upkeep. More income can be gained through conquest and industry, and large amounts through Warchests and plunder.
- **Factories:** Factories allow you to expand your military power by producing weapons and armour. Each factory increases your maximum potential troop count.
- **Recruitment:** To increase your Military Power, you need to recruit and train units -- you can spend *Resources* to do so. You will also have an upkeep cost based on your Military Power, so it is important to balance your economy with MP.
- **Upkeep:** Upkeep is the cost to feed and supply your existing forces, this is taken from your *Resources* at the beginning of each week. Units must be reachable by supply chain to receive upkeep, and units who do not will gain Famine each week.

##### Battle Lines
When at war with a neighbouring faction or invading a foreign territory, both the player faction and enemy faction will have battle lines defined by controlled territories. 

- **Attacking:** When attacking enemy controlled points, the enemy will usually have a defensive advantage -- but the attacker can use battle initiative and artillery to attempt to disrupt this. 
	- **Battle Initiative:** Attackers will often have initiative in battle since they are the aggressors and only they know the exact time and place of the attack (hopefully). This means they will roll first in the combat phase.
	- **Artillery:** Factions with Artillery can use it to reduce a Defender's defensive advantage and reduce its available Military Power. Artillery will be rolled against a Success Chart to determine its effectiveness.
	- **Espionage & Intelligence:** If a faction gains intelligence or is able to plant spies and saboteurs behind enemy lines, they can increase the potency of their attack or decrease the enemy's defensive capabilities.
- **Defending:** Defenders will typically have a defensive advantage due to their fortified position, and this can vary based on the location they are defending.
	- **Fortification Types:** Different fortifications offer certain benefits against the attacking forces. Some may be more suited to reduce the effect of artillery, while others may hinder infantry. A list of these will need to be created.
	- **Mounted Guns & Counter Barrages:** Fortified positions may also offer increased combat potency if they have mounted gun positions. They can also use Artillery to fire Counter Barrages at the attacking forces, reducing their Military Power.
	- **Espionage & Intelligence:** Just as the attackers may use intel to aid their assault, defenders can reduce the effectiveness of the attack by gaining intel. In some cases even removing the battle initiative from the attacker.
- **Outcomes:** Battles will have 2 potential outcomes:
	- **Offensive Victory:** Offensive victory is when the attacking force breaks the defenders position, moving back the battle line and claiming that position for themselves. The defender then rolls a Retreat roll against a Success chart.
	- **Defensive Victory:** Defensive victory is when the defender repels the attacking forces, holding their battle line. The attacker will then roll a Retreat roll against a Success chart.
- **Isolated Positions:** Whether through intentional strategy or miscalculation, a faction may end up with an *Isolated Position*. This means that the position is not connected to their main battle lines and therefore supply chain. Isolated positions cannot get reinforcements, and will gain 1 point of Famine for each week they remain isolated, consult the Famine chart for the effects.
- **Reinforcements:** Many battles will take multiple days or even weeks to fully resolve, as is the nature of slow moving trench warfare. Therefor the ability to call in reinforcements can be vital to achieving victory. Players can call these from nearby forces, or from their Reserve.
	- **Nearby Forces:** Players can call part or all of a nearby force to aid them in battle, to calculate the time to join simply measure the distance and use the forces movement speed. This is usually the best option when help is needed quickly, but may leave other positions weakened.
	- **Reserve:** All factions will have a Reserve of units that can be deployed when needed. The units can be deployed from any Stronghold, and their time to join is based on the distance to the battle location. In many cases this will be much slower than calling on nearby forces, but does not weaken any existing positions.
	- **Time to Join:** Time to join is simply the amount of days (combat rounds) that it takes to reach the battlefield. 
	- **Contested Territory:** Moving reinforcement through contested territory may result in a loss of units or slow their movement speed.

##### Pivotal Battles
Pivotal battles are battles that are recorded in the timeline, and must be resolved in a tabletop skirmish (or set of skirmishes). These battles may have major impacts on the map and will offer large Warchests and potential to earn Glory. These battles occur at specified locations, and are triggered when an attacking force engages that location. These will be primarily notable cities and locations, but may include smaller battles with notable events.

You can also record notable battles on the timeline at your groups discretion, this could be anything from victory against overwhelming odds to specific moments of glory -- or if you want to rub it in, a one sided massacre.
