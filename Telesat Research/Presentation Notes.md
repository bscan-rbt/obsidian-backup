Over the past few days I've been researching and learning about satellites and today I'm going to share some of what I found and answer a few of your questions.

I reordered things a bit from the assignment questions to try to minimize the repetition of information, but I'll do my best to make sure everything is answered in full!

Let's start by talking about the difference between Low Earth Orbit and Geostationary Earth Orbit satellites. Though we'll be primarily talking about GEO satellites today, LEO is especially relevant at this time with the upcoming Lightspeed network from Telesat.

READ SLIDES AND TALK ABOUT POINTS


Now, we can dig a little deeper into GEO satellites, specifically 3 axis GEO satellites. I'm going to give just a brief overview of some of the different subsystems and what responsibilities they have -- while also touching on a few of the questions that were posed in the assignment.

AOCS

Responsible for getting the satellite into its designated box and keeping it there. The attitude and orbital control system is what maintains stability and allows for course and fine pointing.

Use earth sensors, sun sensors, start trackers, magnetometers (earth sensors) and other sensors to determine orientation.

Most satellites use reaction wheels for 3 axis stabilization, though some larger satellites use CMG's -- which operate in a similar fashion as reaction wheels, but are gimballed.

Magnetorquers are also commonly present and used in conjunction with reaction wheels, as they are used to desaturate (slow down) the wheels once they become saturated.

All these systems work together to keep the stability needed to maintain pointing accuracy in orbit.


Payload is a bit of bonus subsystem -- but it felt too important to leave out, as it is responsible for the main tasks and functions of the satellite.

USE SLIDES


The last subsystem we're going to talk about is the power system, which is crucial for the the satellite to complete its operations.

USE SLIDES

The Nimus III being a notable example of one of the first RTG powered satellites ever launched.
SNAP10A, and Kosmos 1818 being examples of satellites using nuclear fission as their primary power source.
