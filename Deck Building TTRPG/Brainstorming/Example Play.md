This is a practical exercise to examine the flow of gameplay, the balance of damage and defence and the synergies between cards.

Example Set Up:

**Players:**

*Bono* - Level 3 Way of the Fist Martialist. D6 Damage -  2 Attack Power - D4 Defence - 2 Defence Rating. Starting HP: 23. 
*Maddy* - Level 3 Stargazer Druid. D8 Damage - 2 Spell Power - D4 Defence - 1 Defence Rating. Starting HP: 25. 
*Larry* - Level 3 Marksman Ranger. D6 Damage - 2 Attack Power - D4 Defence - 2 Defence Rating. Starting HP: 20. 
*Anny* - Level 3 Knight Martialist - D8 Damage - 2 Attack Power - D6 Defence 2 Defence Rating. Starting HP: 28. 

**Enemies:**

4 x Level 3 Bandit:

HP:23
Damage: D6 - 1 AP
Defence: D6 - 1 DR
Resistances: None
Action Points: 3

Actions(Action Point Cost):
Scimitar Slash(1)- 1 x Attack Power Damage
Crossbow (1)- Half Attack Power Damage
Rapid Fire - Once per encounter - Activate rapid fire and fire two Crowssbow attacks per action point until the end of the combat round.

*Reactions:*
Scurry - If being attacked, scramble to attempt to avoid it -- gain +1 DR against this attack.
Attack of Opportunity - If a target leaves your melee range, make a melee attack against them.

*Battlefield:*

A simple roadside battle on relatively flat ground during Daylight.

*Pre-Combat:*
Players spot the bandits first and gain combat priority.

*First Combat Round: Player Turn* (Action Point cost will be denoted next to the ability in brackets)
- *Larry goes first:*
	- Larry uses innate ability Hunter's Mark(1) on Bandit#1
	- Plays Aimed Shot(2) hold your breath and find the perfect shot, make a ranged attack at +1 AP. 
	- Damage is resolved as such: Attack Power: 2 + 1 from Hunter's Mark target + 1 from Aimed Shot. The damage die from his Bow is D6 so he rolls 4D6 damage dice with a result of 14 Damage. 
	- He then rolls a Chance Dice since his Bow attacks can Critically Strike. He rolls a 62 so it is not a critical strike.
	- Bandit#1 uses Scramble to try to mitigate the attack, his defence is calculated as:
	- Defence Rating: 1 + 1 from Scramble, So he rolls 2D6 getting a result of 8. Bandit#1 therefore takes 6 damage, lowering his HP to 17
- *Maddy goes second:*
	- Maddy plays Sunbeam(2) - A beam of intense Sunlight descends from the heavens, burning those in a radius of 15ft. Deals 1/2 SP to all targets hit. Bandit#1 - 2 are caught in the radius.
	- Maddy uses Solar Flare to consume her remaining AP and add +1 SP to the attack
	- Damage is calculated: 2 SP + 1 from Solar Flare. Maddy therefore rolls 3D8 with a result of 19
	- Because the ability specifies 1/2 SP, the damage becomes 19 / 2 rounded up to 10.
	- Bandit#1 - 2 roll 1d6 each from their Defence Rating, with respective result of 2 and 5.
	- Bandit#1 therefore takes 8 Fire Damage and Bandit#2 takes 5 Fire damage, leaving them with 9 and 18 HP respectively.
- *Bono goes third:*
	- Bono uses 20ft of movement to get into melee range of Bandit#1
	- Bono plays Lightning Strikes - You strike with blinding speed, your Basic Attacks only cost 1 AP until the end of the round.
	- He then plays 2 Basic Attack cards
	- Damage is then calculated: AP 2 = 2D6 x number of attacks
	- Bono decides to use both attacks against Bandit#1 getting a total of 15 damage
	- He then rolls a Chance die since his melee attacks can critically strike. He rolls a successful 96, landing a critical strike.
	- Damage is increased to 30
	- Bandit#1 rolls his 1D6 Defence getting a 5. He is therefore slain with heavy overkill damage. 
- *Anny goes last:*
	- Anny uses 25ft of movement to get into melee range of Bandit#3
	- Anny plays Charging Strike(2) - Condition: You must have moved 10ft or more in a straight line this turn. You put the full inertia of your charge into your attack, knocking aside shields and tearing through enemy armour. Make a melee attack roll with +1 AP and 1 Armor Penetration. Enemies cannot the Raise Shield reaction against this attack.
	- Anny then plays Shield Bash(1) - roll 1 AP, if it exceeds the enemies DR roll the enemy is knocked *prone*.
	- Damage is then calculated: 2 AP + 1 from Charging Strike. Anny rolls 3D8  getting a result of 21 non critical.
	- Though the Bandit has 1 DR, it is negated by the 1 Armour Penetration from Charging Attack. He therefore takes the full 21 damage.
