Decks are the core of the gameplay experience, and are a collection of cards offering a variety of combat effects. There are 4 main types of cards: Actions, Items, Consumables, and Strategy.

- *Action* - Action cards represent actions that the players characters can take during combat. These include attacks, defensive reactions, spells and buffs. Action spells will have a action point cost and are discarded after use unless otherwise specified by an effect. 
	- Each class receives a set of 'Basic' Action cards for simple melee attacks and defensive actions.
	- Additional cards are selected on level up, or can be received as rewards for encounters, purchased from trainers and even found in the world.
- *Items* - Item cards are usable items that can be purchased or found and added to a players deck. Item cards may have certain class requirements to play. Items stay on the playing field until destroyed or consumed by their effect. Some items can be repaired if destroyed, this will be specified on the card.
- *Consumables* - Consumables or limited use cards that are held separately from your main hand. This includes things such as potions, scrolls and throwables. 
- *Strategies* - Strategy cards are class specific cards that have context specific effects. They are played face down and activated only when the conditions are met. Players can show these to their team mates but keep the effect hidden from the DM. Some strategy cards may require all the players to work towards a shared goal.
##### Building a Deck and Collection
When players create their character they will receive a base starting deck from their selected class that has 20 cards. If they are multi-classing, they can exchange any number of starting cards with cards from their secondary class's starting deck.

Each time the player levels up they can add 2 cards from their Class Level Up Deck. These can be split between multiple classes if multi-classing.

Powerful enemies, vendors and sometimes unique locations can offer powerful and unique cards.

Players may have cards that are not currently usable or in use, these can be added to their Collection. After a long rest, players can exchange cards from their Collection with those in their Deck while preparing for the day.
###### Requirements and Prerequisites
While there are no level requirements on cards, some cards will have requirements to be used or played. Some are tied to class, attribute values or weapon specializations. Players can keep cards for later use in their Collection.
###### Consumables
All classes have a base capacity of 3 consumables with the exception of Alchemist that starts with 5. This repertoire can be expanded with certain items and class features. Consumables can be stored in the players collection, and swapped during daily preparations. While they are not part of the Players Deck, they still may require action points. 
###### Strategies
Strategy cards are rare and powerful cards that allow the party to set up for powerful effects by completing the listed conditions. Strategy cards effects can be hidden from DM and revealed when the conditions are met.

*Examples:* 

*Harmonious Assault:*

***Class Cards*** - Class Cards are gained from levelling up and class specific feats. Class cards are specific to your class or sub class.
