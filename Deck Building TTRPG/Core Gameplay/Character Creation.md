Players can pick up to two classes from which to build their character from the 9 base classes:

- *Alchemist* - A master of alchemical concoctions, using their potent brews to deal massive damage and increase both defence and combat potency. Alchemists can also specialize in transfiguring materials to create new and exotic mixtures.
- *Bard* - Bard's weave the magic of music into their combat, bewitching the minds of enemies and bolstering their allies. 
- *Druid* - Druid's draw their power from nature and kinship with animals. Druid's can unleash this power to soothe their allies wounds and even take the form of a a bonded animal spirit.
- *Elementalist* - Elementalists channel the powers of the elements to cause devastating damage and restraining their enemies. They can specialize in single elements or weave together multiple elements to build intricate combos. 
- *Priest* - Priests use their divine connections to weave powerful healing magics or unleash pure terror on their enemies.
- *Ranger* - Rangers are versatile and cunning tacticians known for their prowess with ranged weapons. Rangers can use a range of traps and strategies to pick apart even the most stout of defences. 
- *Rogue* - Rogues are masters of the shadows and use lethal hit and run tactics to deal out massive damage. Their guile also extends to their exceptional sleight of hand and silver tongue.
- *Warlock* - Warlocks borrow power from their Demonic Patrons, usually enslaved by powerful binding magics but sometimes more sinister forces are at play. Depending on the Patron, warlocks can channel infernal powers, shadow magic and even summon demonic minions.

After picking their class(es), players can define their characters race and history. See character sheet creator for specifics on each race and their attributes.
