REWORKING FOR SIMPLICITY:

- Base attributes will 1:1 represent combat power based on primary attributes. e.g.: 1 Strength = 1 Attack Power for a barbarian.
- Skills will have minimum stat requirements, or come with specific feats / items. These will be in no way directly derived from primary stats
- Hit points will still scale additionally on Stamina
- Tertiary attributes and critical strike will be gained purely through class feats and gear
- A large portion of feats will be locked behind primary stat requirements to maintain the flavour of each unique stat



**Base Attributes:**

*Strength* - determines the characters physical strength and raw athletic ability. Directly increases *attack power* and may be required to equip certain Great Weapons.

*Dexterity* - determines the characters physical agility and reaction time. Can increase *attack power* with finesse weapons and critical strike chance.

*Intellect* - determines the players capability for wielding the raw forces of magic. Increases *spell power* and may be required to cast more powerful spells.

*Faith* - determines the strength of the players connection to divine beings. Increases *spell power* for faith based casters and allows characters to bind themself to more powerful beings.

*Stamina* - determines physical fitness and resilience to enemy attacks. Increases base health points, movement speed and may be required to wear heavier armor types. 

*Charisma* - determines the players ability to influence other through deception, performance and persuasion. Also also increases spell power in healing magics and bolstering magics. 

**Values:**

Each class has a modifier for how efficiently they use certain attributes. Simply multiply the attribute by this modifier to get your Secondary Attributes. Value's are always rounded up.

*Example(s):* 
The Elementalist class gains spell power from Intellect, with a class modifier of '.2'. So if the Elementalist has 15 Intellect, their spell power value will be 3. 

The Weapon's Master class has a base modifier of '.2' for Stamina, but with the Sturdy feature this is increased to '.3'. So if the Weapon's Master has 12 Stamina, they will receive 4 HP per level. 

**Secondary Attributes:**
Secondary Attributes values are mostly inherited from Primary Attributes, but can be gained from certain equipment, consumables and spells.

*Attack Power* - The primary damage dealing attribute for physical damage dealers. The value determines the amount of dice rolled when dealing damage. The Damage Dice is determines by Class and equipment. Some attacks may specify a multiple of base attack power, such as half or double. Multiply the number of dice by this value and round up if necessary. 
*Example:* A Rogue with 11 Dexterity has 2 Attack Power, and is wielding a D6 Dagger. Therefore when an attack uses the Rogue's Attack Power, it would be rolled as 2D6. 


*Spell Power* - The primary damage dealing attribute for spell casters. Functions in the same manner as Attack Power, though the damage Dice varies based on the caster.
*Example:* Warlocks Damage Dice is determined by the power of their Patron, our Level 2 Warlock is currently using a Lesser Hellfire Demon with a D8 Dice. With 10 Intellect, and a Spell Power of 2, the Spell Power roll would be 2D8.

*Hit Points* - Hit points represent your characters physical and mental well being. Your character becomes *Unconscious* and gains the *Dying* trait when this value hits 0. Hit points are calculated by adding your modified Stamina value to your classes base HP.
*Example:* A Druid with a base HP of 11, has 10 Stamina with a class modifier of '.3'. So at level 3 the Druid would have 23 HP.

*Critical Strike* - Critical Strike determines the chance of achieving a Critical Strike on an attack. Not all attacks or classes are capable of Critical Strikes. The value of this attribute is range that has to be rolled to achieve a Critical Strike.
*Example:* A Rogue has a Critical Strike value of 7, so when rolling the D100 they need to roll a 93 or higher. 

*Defence Rating* - Determines the number of Defence Dice rolled when called on by a Defensive Action. Works similarly to Attack Power and Spell Power.
*Example:* A Range has a Defence Rating of 3 and is wearing Leather Armour with a D4 rating. When taking damage they would roll 3D4 to mitigate incoming damage.

**Tertiary Attributes**
Tertiary Attributes are additional attributes most often gained from specialized equipment and class Features. These are highly limited but very powerful effects.

*Armour Penetration* - Bypass enemy armour, negating Defence Rating equal to the attribute value.

*Hardened* - Your hardened exterior reduces the Attack Power of incoming attacks, negating the value equal to the attribute rating.

*Spell Penetration* - Bypass enemy Resistances, negating Resistance to the associated damage type by the value of the attribute.

*Resistant* - You are resistant to the specified damage type, reduce Spell Power on spells of this damage type by the value of the attribute.
