Exploration will play in a very similar fashion to other TTRPG's. The DM will guide the players and weave the narrative as they see fit. Players can use their classes 'Innate Abilities' to interact with and influence the world around them in the same way you might see in Dungeon's & Dragons. That being said, the DM does have a few tools in their chest that can utilize the RNG and Card mechanics of the game. The Random Events deck allows the DM to add an element of randomness, flesh out a traversal sequence, or simply create an element of unpredictability in a dungeon. This deck can be tailored to the zone or simply be a collection of scripted events and encounters.

Non Combat Encounters - Players have access to Innate Abilities that allow them to navigate out of combat situations using Dice rolls to determine outcomes. Social interactions can be roleplayed like any other TTRPG and puzzles can be overcome using magic and feats of strength. Using your Combat Deck's cards in social situations will often be received with hostility, if not direct retaliation.
