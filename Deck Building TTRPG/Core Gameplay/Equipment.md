Equipment can play an essential part of Player's and some Bosses power, defence, and even utility. There is a wide array of mundane and magically equipment in the world that can be found, taken or purchased to increase your combat potency.

##### Armour

Armour increases your characters survivability in battle, potentially increasing the amount mitigated per Defence Rating. Each type of mundane armour has an associated Damage Die.
