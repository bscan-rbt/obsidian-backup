Dice are used to determine damage, probability and other random events in the world.

*Damage Dice* - Damage dice are rolled to determine the damage that an attack deals. These include D4, D6, D8, D10 and D12.

*Defensive Dice* - Defensive dice are rolled when attempting to mitigate damage. Subtract the Defence roll from the damage being dealt. Defensive Dice are the same as the Damage Dice.

*Chance Dice* - Used to determine Chance outcomes, such as Critical Strikes and Luck. The DM's can also use this to determine random outcomes. This is a D20.

*Skill Dice* - Rolled when determining Skill outcomes such as Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, Athletics, Acrobatics and Knowledge. D20 is the standard dice used for these rolls.
