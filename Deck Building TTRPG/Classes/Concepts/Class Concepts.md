The classes are chosen to be the most fundamental representations of fantasy archetypes, leaving a strong emphasis on multi-classing to achieve more complex fantasy sub-archetypes.

Your class determines which cards you can add to your deck, and which equipment specializations you will have available. You can have a maximum of 2 classes, but some features may allow you limited use of other class cards. Due to the synergistic nature of cards, it is often disadvantageous to split your class too evenly -- usually pushing players to favour one class over the other for the majority of the campaign. That being said, there's no hard limits on how a player must divide their class cards, unless explicitly stated by a class feature.


Example Build:

A player has decided they would like to create a 'Paladin' deck, and chooses Weapon's Master and Priest as their base class. They therefore can pick any number of Priest or Weapon's Master cards when building their starting deck. Since they are looking to emulate a fantasy paladin, the deck should favour Weapon's Master cards and use Priest cards that don't require advanced synergies to be effective. The DM can help gently guide the deck creation process to ensure players have an enjoyable deck to play , but you can also feel free to give the players opportunities to retrofit their deck later on.
