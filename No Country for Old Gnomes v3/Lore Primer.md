Here's for any of you lore thirsty boiiis.


##### Brief History:

Ma'Dovus was believed to have once been home to the greatest civilization to ever grace the world: The Ghu'un Empire. The Ghu'un were master builders and known for their architectural and technological prowess. Their armies had rarely known defeat, and their influence can be seen all across the lands of Gillias. Many believed that their abilities were supernatural and that they had brokered a deal with the gods themselves to gain such power. Whether there is any truth in this may never be known for certain, as in the year 2572 PH nearly the entirety of Ma'Dovus was destroyed by a cataclysmic event known as the Wrath. While the exact source is unknown, a wave of pure energy shattered the lands -- killing nearly all that dwelled within them. It is theorized that the god of Justice himself, Anarius, unleashed the destruction to punish the Ghu'un for encroaching on the territory of the Divine. 

As for the Ghu'un, though not all were killed in the Wrath -- they had many enemies in the North that saw this as an opportunity to invade. With most of their forces, and many of their fortifications destroyed, the remaining Ghu'un surrendered without a fight. Those who were not slaughtered were enslaved and tortured to attempt to extract their knowledge and the source of their power -- though to no avail. The surrender though did not bring peace, as many invaders sought to take the land for themselves. After nearly a century of war, the factions settled into an uneasy peace, creating the Council of Five. The Council of Five created a pact that guaranteed each faction their own land and free travel through the others, as well as a free trade agreement. 
While certainly this was not an end to all war in the country, many of the factions grew to be quite prosperous over the centuries -- though there was a problem that none of them could grasp: the land had fallen into a drought since the Wrath with no end in sight. Eventually, Ma'Dovus could no longer sustain its own food supply,  and the overfished seas could not provide enough sustenance for the growing population. This forced them to rely heavily on importing goods and even water from outside of the land. The population began to dwindle as fewer and fewer people could afford the cost of the imports and the lack of opportunity.

Today, Ma'Dovus is a largely barren land where most of its citizens dwell within the cities. The only remnants of the once mighty Ghu'un Empire were sand worn ruins littered throughout the land. The Council of Five still survived, but only in name. The five factions: Baerg, Darrowton, Vintoras, Crait, and Monaway, still existed but were ruled by disparate leaders each vying for power. The wealthiest and most powerful were the Baergs, sitting in the great fortress city of Rhaek'Etas. 


##### Religions & Gods:
See a full list of Domains [here.](https://2e.aonprd.com/Domains.aspx)

There are many different gods throughout the lands of Gillias, many having different names depending on where they are worshipped. Gods play an active role in the land of Ma'Dovus -- though it is not always clear which ones and what their true motives are.

###### Order of the Blessed Hammer:
The Order of the Blessed Hammer is one of the predominant religions throughout Ma'Dovus, and it's churches and great cathedrals can be found in many different cities. Often called 'the Order', it's followers believe that there was once a pantheon of gods responsible for watching over the land and ensuring the prosperity of those who dwelled there, but long ago the pantheon was corrupted by the whispers of Ranar, Tongue of the Cursed. Ranar twisted the minds of the pantheon, manipulating them into opening a rift between the Abyssal Plane and the Material Plane, opening the way for the Demon Lord Zyk'garav to invade. One god though, Anarius -- resisted the corruption of Ranar and rallied the mortals of Gillias against the Demon Lord. This became known as the War of the Shattered Sky, as it was said that in the final battle, Anarius dealt a blow to Zyk'Garav with his hammer with such power that it shattered the very sky above -- which was said to have once been a window into the land of the Divine. 

To this day, the Order believes that Anarius is waging an eternal crusade against the corrupted gods of the Pantheon, swearing he will one day bring them to justice. Some have already been slain, but 3 remain:
Golian, Haradain, and Ranar himself. 

They also believe it was Anarius that brought for the Wrath on the Ghu'un, as they believe the Ghu'un were consorting with Ranar to gain their near supernatural power.

*Core Beliefs:* The Order believes that Justice is the highest form of order and that all mortals will one day stand before Anarius for judgement. They believe that every being is entitled to a trial, and to be judged fairly regardless of their crime. 

*Holy Relics:* The Order believes that fragments of the Hammer of Anarius can be found throughout the land, left behind from his hammer blow to Zyk'Garav. These fragments are believed to contain the Divine Essence of Anarius. 
They also believe that if one were to find a Sky Shard, they could use it to travel to the land of the Divine.

*Favoured Weapon:* Warhammer

*Anathema(s):*  Vengeance without judgement, demon worship, wanton violence, consorting with any of the corrupted gods


###### Followers of Vardin:
Those who follow Vardin believe that the mortal plight is little more than a contest of strength, and that those who prove their strength in life will have an afterlife. Vardin, also known as the Herald of Truth by those who follow him, was said to have abandoned the land of the Divine to escape the eternal politics and scheming of other gods. He revealed the Truth to those who were willing to listen, that the other gods saw mortals as their pawns and source of energy, and that no salvation could be found in worshipping any of them. The only salvation that can be found is in strength and power -- not just surviving, but dominating the world around you. Only if your soul was strong enough, could it survive the transference to the Ethereal Plane in tact. Otherwise your soul's energy would be scattered to and eventually consumed by lesser gods and devils who were seeking to build their power. 

*Core Beliefs:* Followers of Vardin believe that strength and power are the very goal of life itself, and will seek to prove their strength whenever possible.

*Holy Relics:* It is believed that the Truth is inscribed on the bones of the Listeners, who's remains have been scattered throughout the land. The Listeners were the first mortals to hear the Truth from Vardin. 

*Anathemas:* While there aren't many true anathemas for followers of Vardin, weakness and self sacrifice are viewed as an insult to Vardin.

###### Lunites
Lunites follow Levelyn, Goddess of the Moon, and believe that before Levelyn stole a portion of the Light from the Sun -- that night was once a time a of pure darkness that allowed creatures of the dark to flourish. Her mother was Sulu, Goddess of the Sun who believed that light and dark were equal and was furious about the theft of her Light -- she exiled Levelyn to the moon and bound her to it for eternity, casting only a faint glow of her once great luminance. Lunites believe that each solar eclipse is Sulu passing judgement on her daughter, and that one day she may be set free. They seek to scour the dark places of the earth of any darkness, and expose the great evil that lies there -- hoping this will prove to Sulu the righteousness of her daughter's actions.

*Core Beliefs:* That creatures who dwell in darkness are the source of evil in this world. That light is the physical manifestation of good.
