#side-arc/halloween 

#### Premise:

The party has been invited to a dinner party by a eccentric local aristocrat at his hilltop manor. When they arrive they are greeted with an over the top grotesquery of Halloween props and a décor of decomposed opulence. Curiously the aristocrat is nowhere to be seen, but there are written instructions that guide them to a dinner table. The heavy wooden doors that bar the entry to the room become locked and the murder mystery begins.

1 player will be assigned as the murderer and will have to complete his objectives before the end of the dinner, the remainder of the party will be trying to determine who the murderer is. Classic murder mystery elements and clues will be used here, with 2 acts and scripted events, clues and interactions. These will be played out in combat turn order, with standard PF2e action economy.

Dead players: Dead players cannot talk in game or out, but will have opportunities to communicate with the living through the paintings on the walls. The will be able to exert their will through the veil by manipulating the paintings, but it is an imprecise art, resulting in vague images of colours and shapes. These players will be trying to convey clues to the living as to the identity of the murderer, while facing their own challenges.

#### Time pressure:

In the middle of the room is a large candle fashioned in the shape of a grandfather clock, this candle burns ominously, with unknown consequences when it expires -- though it is implied that no living soul will survive the darkness. If this candle does burn out, all players souls will be removed from their bodies and they will go into the next combat as ghosts.

In addition, the faster they find the murderer, the more living players the party has to fight the lich.

#### BBEG:

While the murderer is one of the players, he's been possessed by the servant of a very powerful lich. When the candle burns out -- or the murderer is discovered the lich will be revealed and attempt to consume the souls of all players. If any living players remain, the first phase will be a PVP combat against the possessed player. If that played kills the remaining players, or is killed -- the lich will take his true form and the party will have to defeat him. Once defeated, that player will regain his faculties and fight with the party in his physical form. The catch is that the lich is only vulnerable while exposed to light. He also carries a lantern used to collect souls that creates an area of effect supernatural darkness. The lich can be defeated by either defeating him in combat or shattering his lantern.

#### Light:

Mundane light sources will have little to no effect on the darkness created by the lantern, but most magical light sources have a chance of breaking through. On cast, magical light sources must pass a DC of 16 to overcomes the darkness, rolling spell hit + spell level. Sustained sources will have to pass the same DC at the beginning of each turn from when they entered combat.

Radiant damage spells can be used with a circumstance penalty of -4.

Supernatural light sources from the ethereal plane will completely suppress the darkness until removed, no DC required.

The lich will be vulnerable to all damage types while inside the radius of any light source powerful enough to suppress the darkness. Otherwise, he can only be damage with radiant damage.

#### Combat:

Living players can play combat normally, using their spells and abilities as usual against the lich. They can use magical light to attempt to overcome the darkness, or attack with radiant damage if available. Most other damage types will not affect the lich without a  strong magical light source. Surrounding the room are numerous mirrors that have been turned around, players can turn them around by passing a strength check with a DC of 14. Mirrors can be used to redirect light sources at 150% of their normal radius / range.

Dead players will also have access to their full kit, but will be fighting on the ethereal plane. They can attack the lantern, but in doing so they release malevolent spirits that they must defeat. When these spirits are defeated, they leave behind a brilliant soul that can be used as a light source that can diffuse the supernatural darkness of the lantern. Once the lantern reaches 50% hp, it will summon a shadowed version of each player ghost. If a player defeats his shadow, he can regain control of his body -- though the party will need some ghosts to assault the lantern.

#### Player Death:

When the lich appears, all players are afflicted with Doomed +4, meaning going down is an instant death. Dead players become ghosts and can continue to fight in the ethereal plane.

#### Ghosts:

While ghosts can't die in the traditional sense, they gain the state 'weakened' when they hit 0hp. While weakened they cannot attack, and the lich will attempt to draw them into his lantern. They must make 3 dying saves, and pass a minimum of 2 to resist the lantern. Other ghosts can use the aid action to give them a +2 circumstance bonus on this roll. If consumed by the lantern, the player is effectively dead until the lantern is shattered.

For the sake of not wiping the party, once per combat round all 'dead dead' players can roll a flat D20 check, combining their rolls to meet the DC which is [party size x 9] (can be adjusted for difficulty). So in a 5 person party, the DC would be 45, meaning that it is only possible of course with 3 dead players. Otherwise, a natural 20 will allow the player who rolled it to escape -- even if the DC is not met by the group.

#### Victory:

If the players shatter the lantern or defeat the lich, all of the trapped souls will be released and any dead players will be returned to their bodies.
