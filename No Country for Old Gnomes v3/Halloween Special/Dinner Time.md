The party enters the manner to find that their host is not yet present, and are directed by the staff to a large dining room with thick wooden doors wrought in black iron. Inside the manor is immaculate, from the d√©cor to the lavish furniture, it looks almost surreal. The dining hall itself is surrounded by an enviable gallery of oil paintings, each scene painted in time consuming and skillful detail.

After the party has sat down, the servants exit the room -- shortly after the ironbound doors close with a resounding thump, trapping the party inside. It quickly becomes clear that something is amiss, and the party will likely start looking for a way out. This is a good time to allow the players to discover some of the details of the room, allow them to roll Investigation and Perception rolls to determine what details they find. Don't give details away for free, make the players look around a bit.

Details:

- There is a large candle in the shape of a grandfather clock that became spontaneously lit when the doors closed.
- There is something odd about the frames of the paintings, they look too thick for the depth of the paintings. Players can discover that the back of the painting is a mirror.
- If the players look through the windows the to the outside, they see only blackness. If they attempt to break the windows, all the windows shatter to the ground -- revealing a solid wall where the windows were. Curiously the glass has been reduced to a fine dust.
- If the players try to move any of the effects in the room (books, silverware, table cloth etc..), the objects immediately appear dilapidated as if untouched for 100's of years.

After the players have had some time to look around the first murder will occur! Read the murder mystery section next.
