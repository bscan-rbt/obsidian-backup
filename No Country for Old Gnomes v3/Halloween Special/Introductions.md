The party finds themselves in the town of New Olleah on the eve of Halloween. Unfortunately they find the town gates have been shut, and the guards refuse their entry.

 While contemplating the next course of action, they are greeted by a courier with an invitation for  the party. The invitation is lavishly ornate and inscribed with name of each party member. The courier goes on to inform them that the invitation is from a tremendously wealthy local aristocrat named Damian Sansanimas , and that refusal would be very unwise. The invitation describes a formal dinner party and Damian's desire to hire their services for a ludicrous sum of gold.

The letter:

Dear [name],

I apologize for the hastiness of this invitation, but when the news of your arrival here in New Olleah reached my ears, I knew I must meet with you at ONCE. If the tales of your deeds old even a fraction of truth, then you are truly the heroes for which I have yearned. Please, allow to treat you with all the humble hospitality I can muster on such a short notice, and join me for a sumptuous feast at my manor here on Olleah Hill. I swear that you shall be wanting for nothing before the night is over!

Pleasantries aside, I do also have some business I was hoping you may be able to help with -- for which you would be MOST amply rewarded. Name a price and you shall have it!

You will find my carriage offers quite a comfortable ride with more than adequate space, so please allow my driver to give you a opportunity to rest your weary feet before the nights festivities. Please don't fuss about your travel attire, you will find we are quite casual here!

Look forward to meeting you!

Yours humbly & truly,

Damian Sansanimas

The carriage ride will give the players an opportunity to discuss the invitation and is a good time to start setting the spooky mood for the 1 shot. Halloween music, dim lights -- especially candle light, hushed tones and grim descriptors are all strongly recommended. If you're running this online, force your players to use Dark Mode (as if any sane person wouldn't anyways)

Arrival at the manor: As you pass through the manor gate, the rhythmic rumbling of the wagon wheels is replaced with the sharp clatter of cobblestone and through the warped glass windows of the wagon you see the spearpoint spires of the manor silhouetting menacingly against the nearly waxed moon. The soft whisper of the cool evening breeze is suddenly replaced with the rush of wind and dancing treetops. The once vague details of the night landscape, now etched in heavy shadows by the cascading moonlight, eerily sharp against the inky black  horizon. As you approach, you are greeted with an impressive sight -- the manor a clear display of wealth and craftsmanship of years past. The hulking structure presented a façade of artfully decadent reliefs, it's ornate front doors flanked by a set of enormous columns to provide structure to the roof  25 feet above. At last the wagon comes to a stop, and the driver promptly opens the doors and directs you towards the manor entrance.
