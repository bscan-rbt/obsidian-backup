Murder mystery time!

Setup:

Each player will be given a card with their role and goals, a similar setup to the game Werewolf.

Roles:

- Spellwarder (DC14): You can place a protective ward on one target that protects them from harm through the night. Your roll determines the circumstance bonus of your protective ward. DC 12: Critical Failure -4 | Failure 0 | Success +2 | Critical Success +4
- Innocent bystander (DC12): Good luck, tuck your head between your legs and hope for the best. Roll against a DC of 14 to get a +2 circumstance bonus to your Kill DC.
- Murderer: Point at one target to be murdered, your roll will be weighed against that players DC. The murderer can reroll once during the night if they rolled poorly. This comes at the risk of being caught if people hear the sound.
- Investigator (DC20): Needs to collect clues to identify the identity of the murderer. There are a total of 9 pieces of evidence that the investigator needs to find, and 3 of which can correctly identify the murderer. The investigator can roll once per turn to 'investigate'. If they roll equal or higher than the murderer, they find a piece of evidence. In addition, a piece of evidence is added each time a the murderer is successful.
- The investigator
-  must identify the 3 pieces of evidence and submit them, and if they are correct the identity of the murderer is revealed.

- Trickster DC14: The trickster can cast mirror image (2 casts for the evening)  on one target, if the murderer selects that target they must roll at disadvantage.

If the murderer is properly condemned, it will trigger the next bead: COMBAT
