The Bearg Merchants are one of the five original factions to invade Ma'Dovus after The Wrath. Known for their unfathomably deep pockets, they used their wealth to quickly establish themselves as the dominant power in the country. Building massive mercenary armies and employing the most skilled siege engineers in the known world, the factions had no choice but to acquiesce power. 

**Leader:** The Merchant Prince Va'ren - A larger than life man who's considerable wit and charm have made him beloved by his people. He's used his influence to establish reliable trade routes across the Baelerian Sea, using naval patrols to ensure the safe passage of merchant vessels.

**Home:** The Bearg's mostly reside in the coastal city of Rhaek'Etas, a fortress city with the largest port in all of Ma'Dovus. A significant portion of all trade goods in the country enter through this port.
