- Skorpa can find out that the real vinny still lives and try to rescue him
	- He has flee'd into the desert and was captured by the lizard folks
	- The lizard folks seem to have decided he's an entertaining play thing and have given him to the hatchlings as a toy
	- The lizard folk are not openly hostile towards the party immediately, but very suspicious
- Marius shows up after the events of the church inquiring to the source of the noise
	- Mentions that he's late because he tripped on his carpet and got pie all over himself
	- Tell's the party of reports that the 'bandits' have fortified and seem to be amassing forces
	- Marius has called the guard to start mounting a defence
- If the players visit the ruins, they will find thousands of hollow carapaces of dead scorpions and at the and of the maze the remains of 3 adventurers on the moonlight altar
	- One looks to be setting with something held in his hand: a note
	- The note reads: Please forgive us... We did not know... It must be stopped... The sound... Find the cleric if he lives...
	- At this moment they will hear the chittering sound in the distance
	- Bernard can find magical inscriptions of Anarius leading out of the ruins, they lead off into the desert towards the mountains (this leads to vinny and the lizard folk)
- If the players visit the tribals, they will see that the small camp is now bustling war camp with at least 200 tribals.
	- The guards surround them and ask what their business here is -- if they press the matter they will be taken to Jhae'mar
	- Jhae'mar tells them that negotiations with Marius have proved fruitless and that they have no choice but to take the town by force and remove him
	- If asked about the well, he will say that they knew the risks and that he could not be faulted if they went in so underprepared. He can tell them about about the wyvern, that it is born of the power that dwells in the well itself. It's mind twisted from a millenia of darkness under the earth. 
	- He tells them they may leave this camp peacefully this time as a concession for their friends sacrifices, but that they must soon pick sides or risk becoming enemies of the Ghu'un. Marius has 2 days to surrender, or he will attack and remove him by force.
- Jhae'Mar will lead an attack in 2 days time
