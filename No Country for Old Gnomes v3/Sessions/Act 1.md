###### Opening Scene:
- The scene opens to the caravan being pursued by an unknown creature, players will need to use their abilities to try to escape and keep as much of the caravan in tact as possible.
- After a small set of Challenge rolls, the players will have to decide whether to save the supply cart or the passenger cart.
- After this the roars and sounds of pursuit will fade into the distance, and the remainder of the caravan will arrive at the town of Cervez, and Gideon will send the party to seek aid
- The party will find many of the locals suspicious of them and unwilling to help. But here they can meet Vin Delus -- the local Cleric of Anarius and only clergy member of the town. He offers to come out to the caravan and heal any wounds.
- When the players are asked what happened, they won't have a clear answer as they don't know what the creature that pursued them was. Any locals will talk about rumours of travellers disappearing, and even the bandits fear to venture too far out into the desert.
- After this players will have some time to RP before bed 

###### The Following Morning
- In the morning, the extent of the damage to the caravan is even more obvious. How much exactly will depend on how well the players did in the intro.
- Likely the players will have saved the passenger cart -- if this is the case they will be tasked to resupply, namely with water. If they saved the supply cart, they will be tasked to recruit more caravan members.
- After some sleuthing in town they will find that Cervez is struggling due to its water supply being occupied by 'bandits'.
- The local governor will offer to resupply / send them manpower if they help to reclaim this water supply

**Intro Blurb:**

I invite you to discover the land of Ma'Dovus, a land of of both stunning beauty and ancient terrors. This is not a tale of great kings or mighty emperors, this is a tale about you few brave adventurers. How will you overcome challenges laid before you? Do you have what it takes to survive the dangers that stalk these lands? Are you a hero? A Villain? I look forward to finding out, and I hope I can share some of the joy that creating this world brought me. 




The setting sun now hangs low in the sky, it's amber rays filtering through the clouds of dust behind you, casting a strangely beautiful shimmer on the sandy hills. The arid air filled with the smell of earth, punctuated by whiffs of musk from the gargantuan beast at the head of the caravan. ....Then you hear that sound again. The once indistinct clicking in the distance has become a sharp chatter, followed by the hushed murmurs of the other occupants of the cabin. 

**Here players can talk and introduce themselves if desired**

Shortly after the sound is heard again, sharper and louder than before. The chatter now a loud clatter, like metal plates being dropped one another. 

**Allow some RP and ability usage**

The lookout calls for the caravan to halt -- he's spotted something. The caravan slowly comes to a creaking halt and they can look around to try and spot what the lookout saw. They hear faint cursing and mumbling on the wind, and the heavy feet of one who's lost his way. Over the hill comes a hobgoblin, clad in only his undergarments and badly burned by the sun. He swats at the empty air near his feat, mumbling something indistinct about stingers and too many.

**Here the party will meet Deez Knudz, he's Confused and incoherent and needs to be snapped out of it. The party can use spells and abilities to try to break this state. A slap to the face would be sufficient, but lets see what people come up with.** 

Meanwhile the caravan has resumed it's journey, and the creaking rumble of the wheels once again fill the air.

**After some RP time...**

Up ahead you hear the crack of whips and feel the wagon begin to accelerate. Behind you, the steady cloud of dust has been replaced by a surging torrent of sand and limbs. A malevolent form seems to thrash within the dust, gaining on the rear cart with alarming speed. The once rhythmic thrum of the wagon wheels, now a panicked percussion of creaking wood and beastial roars. The clanging chatter now nearly deafening, pushing the panic inside the caravan over the top.

**Players can used abilities to try to slow down the attack:**
*A DC 14 will successfully slow down the attacker, giving the caravan a +2 circumstance bonus for their next roll (gives them more time to release the cart)*

The entire caravan shudders as the creature tears into the rear passenger cart. The screams of terror barely audible against the deafening chatter. Suddenly the door on the cabin roof bursts open... Gideon Giron, the caravan leader stands above you. 

*He tells the players that they need to let the rear cart loose or the entire caravan will be destroyed, players will have to move along the top of the caravan back to the wagon and a DC18 Athletics check needs to be passed to remove the cart. Gideon will aid offering a +2 bonus on the roll, and other players can aid as well, or use any abilities that may help the situation.*

The cart releases, tumbling into the sand in a violent roll. The maelstrom of dust quickly engulfs it, and the chattering sound begins to slowly fade as the sight of the mayhem slips further into the distance.

*Players will have some time to talk here to Gideon, who is broken up about the people who were inside the cart. They can RP for some time, and Gideon will tell them they are close to their destination -- Cervez. He also says they can't hold this pace much longer as the wagons are falling apart -- they were not made for this kind of speed.*

Not long after Gideon mentions this, they hear a loud crack and the caravan comes to a grinding halt. One of the wheels has cracked and collapsed. Gideon curses and jumps off to go assess the damage. He will then inform the party that he must ask for their help again -- they're going to need help repairing the caravan and they're sitting ducks out here in the desert. He asks that they go into town and get help ASAP.

It's about an hour on foot to the town of Cervez. When the party arrives, it's early in the evening and the sun has just gone down. They can search the town to find help.

##### Cervez:

*Locations:*
- Town Noble's Mansion - Large, gaudy, gated with guards. Smells of seafood.
- Saloon - An old wood plank saloon, dusty and smells of sour liquor
- Chapel - Small but tasteful, single room, extensive artwork of Anarius
- General Store - Cramped and crammed full of antique goods, owner is an eccentric horder. Smells of oil and dust
- Inn - A sparse inn with 4 rooms available, cheap, hard beds, owner is curt but fair
- Various houses - See townsfolk

*Townsfolk:*
- Marius B. Darrowton the IIIrd - Town Noble / Governor. Human, short, plump and pompus. Smells of seafood
- Vin Delus - Local cleric of Anarius. Gnome, jumpy, fast talking
- Bar Keep (Garth) - A man of few words, prefers to communicate in grunts
- Johnny - Young adventurer, very gung ho about going on an adventure
- Faenuin (Will be introduced as Allaina) - Secretly a Devil, claims to be fortifying the town against demonic invasion. Says the planar veil is thin here.
- Arch Stanton - Current leader of the Tombstone gang, but the gang is divided. Reserved, an air of control, articulate

*Breadcrumbs:*
- There's been a string of arsons in Cervez, and Vin Delus believes they were set by a devil.
- Marius B. Darrowton wants the party to clear out the old oasis of 'bandits' to restore their water source
- Johnny wants to join the adventure, but is annoying
- Garth has debts with the Tombstones and asks for your help to resolve them
- Arch Stanton has a mutiny forming in the Tombstones and wants you to help quell it


**Main Beads:**

- For the party to resupply, they will need to find a source of water. The biggest source in the area is the old oasis, but it has become occupied by what Marius is calling bandits.
- If the players choose to go to the oasis, they will find that these are not bandits -- but Ghu'un tribals, who claim that this is their oasis. Taking it by force would be veeery difficult and risky.
- The leader Jhae'Mar suggests they attempt to restore the well, an ancient well powered by the magic of the Ghu'un
- If the players choose to attempt this, they will find the well infested with large scorpions and have to solve a puzzle. Upon solving it they are surrounded by scorpions, leaving only one route -- enter the well.
- Inside the well, they find themselves in a massive cistern with large pillars placed around the room. There's an alter in the center, and carved reliefs of the different phases of the moon.
- On the pillars there are polished steel mirrors,
