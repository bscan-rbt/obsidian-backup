Northern Ma'Dovus (especially Darrowton territory) is controlled by a organization of bandits known as the Coffin Nails. Well occupied by many smaller groups, the Tombstones is a highly organized and lucrative criminal organization, with their hands in many different ventures both legal and illegal. Many local law enforcement and politicians are on their payroll. Most of this is due to the leadership of Arch Stanton, a measured and calculating man who knows how to keep the wheels greased and play both the aristocrats and the working man. Recently though, some of the other prominent gang members believe he was going soft due to his anti violence policies.

*Breadcrumb:* Players are enlisted by local law enforcement and sent to try to take down Arch Stanton. Arch Stanton though becomes aware of this plot, and sends his envoys the intervene, pleading that the players give him an audience.

*The Audience:* Arch Stanton meets the players under their terms, and agrees to come unarmed. He says he wishes to broker peace with them, and that peace is all his organization seeks despite the bad eggs. He tells them of the mutiny forming among the gangs, and that killing him will only cause far more death and chaos as these more violent members compete for leadership. The players can of course choose to kill him here, regardless of the moral implications, but if they choose to help him -- he will give them the details of the 3 leaders of the mutiny. He asks that they are brought to justice for their crimes, and leaves it up to them to decide whether thats dead or alive. 

*The Mutineers:* 
- **Dagar Dunmorow:** Dagar is a short but agile man who wields two ornate daggers, with a number of finely carved coffin nails on them. If asked, he tells people that each coffin nail represents a time he managed to escape death, and that when he dies they will need to use that many nails to ensure he doesnt return in undeath. Dagar has a reputation for leaving no survivors whenever he raids or plunders, saying that the dead don't speak to the living. He believes that Arch Stanton is a weak man for choosing to avoid violence, and that this weakness will be the downfall of the Tombstones.
- **Boon the Brute:** Boon is a large muscular man, who seems to have done everything in his power to earn his moniker. He and his thugs fight with barbed clubs, and are often used as enforcers and hired muscle to chase after debtors. Boon is steadfast in his hatred of oligarchs and the powers that be, and sees Arch Stanton's policies as a form of collusion with the enemy.
- **Six Eye:** Six Eye is a self possessed man who believes himself to have been blessed by Vardin and tasked with culling the weak from this world. His name earned from the 4 open eye tattoos on his forehead, representing the vigilance of the god Vardin. He believes that Arch Stanton has given into the weakness of man, and must be killed to appease the gods. 

**The Quest:** Players can seek out each of the 3 mutineers and choose to capture or kill them.  They will soon find out that the local sheriff was in fact on Dagar's payroll and will bring the local law against the players. For this time they will be fugitives in that town, and must operate under the radar.
