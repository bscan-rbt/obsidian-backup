**Enemies:**
*Moonlight Guardian* - Level 5 Construct - The moonlight guardian starts as indestructible. He also moves extremely slow at first, and struggles to deal damage. On his chest there is a Moon, starting in the New Moon phase. Each turn the moonlight guardian spends in moonlight, the phase of the moon advances -- increasing the damage it takes and deals. When it gets the full moon phase, it gains the ability Moonlight Cleansing: An AOE pulse that needs to be line of sighted to avoid the damage. Those who are hit, take a large amount of damage and must make a Con save or become blinded for 1 turn. If the guardian is not in the moonlight, his moonphase will decrease by one each turn. 

**Other Mechanics:**
Moonlight Orb - When the players arrive in the room, there is an orb of moonlight in the centre of the room. The orb provides a source of moonlight, but also each turn that the carrier holds it they gain a stack of *Moonlit* - You take increased damage from all attacks, but deal increased damage.
The Moonlight Guardian will also fixate whoever has the orb. If players drop the orb, it will begin to glow intensely, as will the guardian. The guardian will begin pulsing AOE damage on the start of his next turn if its not picked up.


*Moonlit:*
 - 1 - You feel strangely effervescent, you feel power tingling down to your finger tips. +2 to hit, all weapon and spell attacks gain the Razing trait. You gain 5 Weakness to physical damage.
 - 2 - The tingling builds into a fearsome pulsing power that reverberates throughout your entire body. +4 to hit, +1 damage die to all attacks and spells. You gain 10 weakness to physical damage
 - 3 - The power begins to overwhelm your senses, but the raw energy is intoxicating. Rays of cold moonlight radiate from your chest. +6 to hit, +2 damage die to attacks and spells. You gain 15 weakness to physical damage. You now count as a source of Moonlight, and must make a DC 16 Will saving throw to pass the orb.




*Inscription*

Fear not the grace of her light
For it gives us the strength to fight
But brittle are the warriors of night
So be wary of one who glows too bright
