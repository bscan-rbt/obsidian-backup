#### Setting:
The campaign takes place in the land of Ma'Dovus -- long ago it was home to the mighty Ghu'un empire and thought to be the centre of all civilization. Now the land is fractured and arid, suffering from what seems to be an eternal drought of which the source remains a mystery. Even so, the once unified country is heavily contested by a number of factions, each with their own motives to hold the land. Many still believe that the ruins left behind from the Ghu'un carry untold treasures and possibly even the secret source of their power, others are simply opportunists looking to get their piece.

Your heroes will be travelling with a caravan bound for the great coastal city of Rhaek'Etas -- currently the home of the most powerful faction in Ma'Dovus, the Bearg Merchants and the Merchant Prince Va'ren. Due to the perilous state of the country, travelling in a caravan is generally the safest and most reliable way to travel -- especially with the limited water supply.

**Other Setting Details:**
- *Magic:* While magic is prevalent in the world, it is uncommon for the average denizen to know it or use it. Because of this, spell casters may find they are greeted with mistrust if they openly use their powers. 
- *Combat:* This campaign will not to be purely combat focused, and you can expect on average one combat per session. That being said... There can always be more if your characters blood lust is not sated. We can talk about combat lethality and other stuff during Session 0!
- *Scarcity:* Supplies in this world are scarce, especially water. The ability to scavenge and survive in dangerous environments will definitely come in handy.


#### Character Building Info:
- *Starting Level:* 3
- *Starting Attributes:* Standard Point Buy (max base stat is typically 15, but if you want to take an L on another stat to hit an even 16, let me know)
- *Starting HP:* Starting HP is Class Base HP + (Hit Die x Level). Roll your HP, but if you roll less than half your hit die, increase the result to half rounded up. (Example: Your Hit Die is a D10, you roll 3D10 and get 7, 8, 3 -- increase the 3 to a 4.)
- *Race Limitations:* None, but some may be less well received by locals
- *Questions to answer for your character:*
	- *Who is your character?* Where did they come from? How did they get their powers (if any)? Have they already spent time in Ma'Dovus, or are they travelling from a far off land?
	- *What motivations does your character have for being here?* Greed, revenge, scientific curiosity, humanitarianism? Perhaps they have a personal quest that has led them here or they are tracking a target.
	- *What are some of your characters fears?* 
	- *What brings your character joy?*
	- Your characters backstory can be as long or as short as you want, but anything you write here will help me build those hooks!
- If you want to have pre-existing relationships with any of the other players, feel free to collaborate in the discord and set those up.
