##### Factions

**Beargs:**
The Bearg Merchants is an alliance of the wealthiest and most influential merchant families in from small coast territory of Bearg in northern Gillias. Their current leader Va'ren is well known through the land as a cunning military tactician and ruthless business man. His leadership has kept the Beargs in a seat of power despite the rising tensions in Ma'Dovus. The Beargs rebuilt the coastal fortress city of Rhaek'Etas, which even in ruins was quite a formidable structure. 

*Races:* Mixed
*Leader:* Merchant Prince Va'ren
*Religion:* Mixed -- but many follow Denomes - the Goddess of Civility & Dignity.

**Darrowtons:**
The Darrowtons are the 'legitimized descendants' of the notorious Darrowton crime family. Their fortune was built on smuggling goods between factions during the War of the Wrath and used that wealth to establish a seat of power in the North. They spent many centuries establishing a small criminal empire, and eventually were 'legitimized' as a line of nobility. The issue was, not many could trace their true lineage back to the original Darrowtons -- so pretty soon hundreds of 'Darrowtons' began to appear around the country, making their claim to nobility. While many of these were proven false and legitimized, no one is entirely sure how many of the current Darrowtons have any claim to their power. 

*Races:* Mixed, but predominantly humans.
*Leaders:* Too many to name
*Religion:* Followers of Vardin, called the god of the Strong


**Vintoras:**
The Vintoras Monarchy is a kingdom established by a once militant group of elves that had been forced from their lands. 


**Technorats:**

A colony of technologically advanced rats, who's actual name (Hrshgnets) is borderline unpronounceable by most other sentient beings -- so they're called the technorats. The technorats are scavengers who seek to repurpose anything mechanical, and are convinced that one day they will be able to build a god.
