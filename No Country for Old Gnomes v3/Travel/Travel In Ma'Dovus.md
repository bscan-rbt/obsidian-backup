Ma'Dovus being a arid land with water sources being few and far between -- travel can be a difficult task over long distances. Travelling in a large caravan in the safest and most reliable method as it offers strength in numbers against external threats and the capacity to tow large amounts of supplies. That being said, it's not always feasible to travel in such a way.

##### Supply Planning:
Preparing for a long overland journey requires some preparations, some of which can be acquired as resources and others simply as part of the planning process.

**Resources:**

- *Supplies:* Supplies are just an abstraction of everything the party needs to carry to travel safely. This includes food, water and other basic necessities as described by the players. Ask them what they think they need to bring, don't punish them for not specifically naming a resource. You can simply set a specific supply cost for a journey based on distance and difficulty. Establish a fixed rate per day to keep things consistent, tracking travel by time is often easier and more relevant than the distance itself. 
- *Strategy:* Have the players strategize how they will deal with the different challenges that the road may possess, giving them circumstance bonuses if they gathered additional information about the areas. Some possible ideas:
	- Set watches for security, allowing players with high perception or sight altering feats to flex their muscles.
	- Use survival and lore skills to navigate the land more effectively, reducing the cost of travel and lower the chance of issues occuring.
	- Disguises - players can disguise themself when going into hostile territory, reducing the chance that they are identified by the enemy.
- *Personal goals:* Have the players set personal goals and tasks for the road, which can be rolled as basic skill challenges.

**Events:**

Events on the road should not be entirely random, and should feel like part of world. Make them specific to the region or area, give them meaningful outcomes or provide valuable information for their travel. Even something as simple as a warning about dangerous terrain, or rumours of a powerful creature.


Example Travel:

The party wants to go to explore a an old ruin in a remote area of the desert. It's about a 2 day journey from civilization. 

*Daily Supply Cost:* 5 per party member (let it be implied that NPC's deal with their own supplies). So for a party of 5, this journey would require 50 supplies.
